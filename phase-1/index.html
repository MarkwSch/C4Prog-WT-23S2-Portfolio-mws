                <h3>Teacher + Student = dumb and dumber</h3>
                    <p>
                        This content is derived from APC Magazine, November 2007.
                        <br><br>
                        We had no idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students out there.
                        <br><br>
                        The stories just keep coming in.
                    </p>
                <h3>COPY, COPY</h3>
                    <p>
                        David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                        students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                        statement that it was all their original work.
                        <br><br>
                        Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                        three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                        that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
                        <br><br>
                        End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                        and pasting to cover assignment work.
                    </p>
                <h3>THAT'S MY LECTURE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.
                        But IT lecturers are a funny lot.
                        <br><br>
                        Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.
                        <br><br>
                        "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                        as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                        to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                        the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                        IE7.
                        <br><br>
                        'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                        should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                        present a talk on internet security."

                <h3>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h3>
                    <p>
                        Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                        with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
                        <br><br>
                        "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                        the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                        lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                        stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                        instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                        front of a room full of students.
                        <br><br>
                        So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                        popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
                        <br><br>
                        Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                        'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                        floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                        since been decommissioned.
                        <br><br>
                        Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                        and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                        she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
                        <br><br>
                        And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                        shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                        their computers with care!"
