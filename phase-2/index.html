                <h2>Teacher + Student = dumb and dumber</h2>
                    <p>

                        We had no idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students out there.
                        <br><br>
                        The stories just keep coming in.

                <h2>COPY, COPY</h2>
                <p>
                    David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                    students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                    statement that it was all their original work.
                    <br><br>
                    Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                    three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                    that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
                    <br><br>
                    End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                    and pasting to cover assignment work.

                <h2>THAT'S MY LECTURE</h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.
                    But IT lecturers are a funny lot.
                    <br><br>
                    Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.
                    <br><br>
                    "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                    as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                    to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                    the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                    IE7.
                    <br><br>
                    'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                    should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                    present a talk on internet security."

                <h2>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h2>
                <p>
                    Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                    with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
                    <br><br>
                    "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                    the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                    lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                    stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                    instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                    front of a room full of students.
                    <br><br>
                    So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                    popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                    'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                    floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                    since been decommissioned.
                    <br><br>
                    Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                    and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                    she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
                    <br><br>
                    And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                    shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                    their computers with care!"
